                            We know the recent news and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) may have you taking a deeper look at your current travel plans and future options. It is a weird time right now (to say the least) and difficult to judge what things will be like in a few months.  
                            <br><br>
                            <b>We do not have any plans at this time to cancel or postpone this year’s Class of 2017 Pi Reunion, and we wanted to let you know that we will be working to stay aware of any new impacts and updates to travel policies to keep you informed.</b> We will be looking at guidance from MIT, the CDC, and other health professionals. 
                            <br><br>
                            However, in the event that the Class of 2017 Pi Reunion is cancelled, we will be giving full refunds for cancellation. This will include refunds for hotel reservations and registration. More info to come on hotel and events to come! Please keep an eye on your emails for more information as the situation progresses.
                            In the meantime, everyone remember to wash your hands thoroughly, try to avoid large crowds, and take care of yourselves and your families! ❤️

                                <br>The 2017 Pi Reunion event (held in the summer of 2020) is primarily for alumni of the MIT Class of 2017, however, any MIT alumni is invited to attend. Additionally, MIT alumni can bring guests.

                                <br>The 2017 Pi Reunion is organized by a group of volunteer alumni from the class of 2017. Please go check out their bios!

                                <br>The Pi Committee will reserve a block of rooms in a hotel and organize a handful of events, shows, clubs, etc., to coordinate reunion activities. The Reunion will span a weekend, starting with a kickoff party (specific details soon!). Between these larger events, you’ll have many optional events/shows to attend alongside your classmates.

                                <b>How much will this cost?</b>
                                <br>While we haven’t solidified our budget or ticket prices yet, the price associated with Pi Reunion can be broken into a few categories. Your registration fee will cover the background expenses associated with running an event this large. You'll be responsible for the cost of your hotel room, although we will be negotiating a discount for our block. Each additional event/show/activity you elect to participate will have its own cost associated with it. Your committee is working hard to bring down costs of this event, so stay tuned!

                                <b>How do these hotels work?</b>
                                <br>The committee will negotiate with hotels along the Vegas strip to find the best rates possible. Attendees will be able to reserve rooms from within the negotiated block for the discounted rate. Multiple alumni and their non-MIT guests can elect to room together for a maximum capacity of four people; this will not be coordinated by the Pi Committee. Additionally, there will be larger suites that you can choose to upgrade to. You are not required to stay in the Pi Reunion hotel block, although our negotiated rates represent a significant discount and are contingent on booking a certain percentage of the block. Plus, our events are being planned around our hotel location!
